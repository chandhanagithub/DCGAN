# DCGAN
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
## Overview
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using TensorFlow 2. This GAN is designed to generate handwritten digits similar to those found in the MNIST dataset. The generator produces images based on random noise input, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.13.0 or later
Additional libraries: imageio, matplotlib, numpy, PIL
